# Automatic purging
# This will be performed every time the plugin is loaded, up to once every 12 hours.
# Times are formatted the same as lookups. (e.g. 10w is 10 weeks)

  Enabled: false
  # When a purge is performed, how long should entries be retained?

  # How many days should the plugin wait between purges? i.e. how often should a purge be performed?
  # Note: regardless of this setting, the plugin will only perform purges during startup

  Table:
    # Set any table to "off" to disable.
    # Set any table to "default" to use the 'default' setting. It is recommended to leave these as default unless you want more control.

# Note: This action list is mostly generated by the plugin at runtime. 
# Disabling an action here will remove the ability to look up that
# action as well as disable the logging of that action.
# It will not affect any data currently in the database, which is only
# removed during a purge.

    # This is mostly useful for worlds which have separate inventories like creative worlds.

    # The logging interval in ms. This does not affect logging on join, leave, or worldchange.
    Interval: 3600000
    # Enables differential logging and searching of inventories down to the second. 
    # This feature is experimental and will consume significantly more disk space.
    # Do not use this feature if your server is medium to large.
    Diff-Interval: 0
    # Use this if you run into issues with death inventories being empty. 
    # This is usually due to a plugin like DeathChests clearing the inventory before AuxProtect sees it.
