## Contributors
Thank you for considering helping out. :)
Please base any PRs off of the `refactor-modules` branch, that is my working branch and has pretty significant structure changes.
### Formatting
- Ask, before you work on a PR, if the change is something I would implement. I don't want you to waste time if it's not something I want added.
- Please only change code that is necessary to your PR.
- Do not use wildcard imports. (e.g. `java.util.*`)
- Try to match the formatting of the rest of the code. (IntelliJ default autoformat with the exception of wildcard imports)
